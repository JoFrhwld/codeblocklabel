# Codeblocklabel Extension For Quarto

DOESN:T WORK!
## Installing

_TODO_: Replace the `<github-organization>` with your GitHub organization.

```bash
quarto add <github-organization>/codeblocklabel
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

_TODO_: Describe how to use your extension.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal example: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
